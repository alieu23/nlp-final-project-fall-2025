# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews  *Project Proposal — Detecting Bias Toward Actors and Directors*---## 👥 Group Members- **Abdoulie Jallow**  - **Charles Adomako Basoah**  - **Alieu Samateh**---## 🧭 OverviewMovie reviews often reveal more than just opinions about films — they may also reflect **implicit biases** toward specific actors or directors.  For example, a mediocre film starring a beloved actor may receive disproportionately positive reviews, while an excellent film featuring a controversial figure may be judged more harshly.  This project investigates **whether sentiment in movie reviews is influenced more by the named entities (actors/directors)** than by the film’s content itself. Understanding such bias is crucial for enhancing **fairness and interpretability** in sentiment analysis systems, such as recommendation engines and reputation modeling frameworks.---## 🎯 Task DefinitionThis is a **binary classification and bias detection** task.- **Input:** A movie review containing named entities (actors or directors)  - **Output:**    - **Sentiment label:** Positive / Negative    - **Attribution score:** Quantifies whether the sentiment is driven more by the named entity or by the movie content  **Goal:** Detect and measure sentiment bias toward specific individuals.---## 📊 DatasetWe will use a combination of:- **IMDb Large Movie Review Dataset**    - Developed by the *Stanford NLP Group*    - Contains **50,000 labeled movie reviews** (25,000 train / 25,000 test)    - Each review labeled as *positive* or *negative*    - Available at: [Hugging Face: stanfordnlp/imdb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/imdb)- **TMDb (The Movie Database)**    - Used to extract **cast and crew metadata** (actors and directors)  **Processing Steps:**- Apply **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to extract mentions of actors/directors  - Use **entity linking** models to associate mentions with real individuals  - Combine review sentiment labels with entity metadata for bias analysis---## ⚙️ Proposed ApproachOur hybrid pipeline integrates **sentiment classification** and **bias attribution**:1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**     Identify mentions of actors and directors in review text.2. **Sentiment Classification:**     Fine-tune **DistilBERT** for binary sentiment classification on IMDb reviews.3. **Attribution Analysis:**     Use **attention weights** or **SHAP values** to interpret token-level contributions to sentiment.4. **Bias Quantification:**     Compare average sentiment for reviews that mention specific individuals vs. those that do not, controlling for confounding factors like movie rating and genre.This method enables both **classification accuracy** and **bias interpretability**.---## 🧪 Baselines and BenchmarksWe will compare our proposed approach against:| Model | Description ||--------|-------------|| **Most-Frequent Class Baseline** | Predicts the dominant sentiment class || **Classical Models (Logistic Regression / Linear SVM)** | Trained on bag-of-words features without entity information || **DistilBERT (No NER)** | Transformer-based sentiment classifier ignoring entity mentions || **DistilBERT (With NER + Attribution)** | Our proposed model incorporating bias detection and interpretability |This comparison will help evaluate whether including entity-level attribution improves bias detection performance.---## 📈 Evaluation MetricsWe will use:- **Macro-F1 Score:** For sentiment classification (accounts for class imbalance)  - **Token-Level Attribution Scores:** Measure how strongly entity tokens influence sentiment  - **Entity-Level Sentiment Skew:** Quantifies deviation in sentiment toward named entities  These metrics together will assess both **classification performance** and **bias magnitude**.---## 📚 References- Maas, A.
